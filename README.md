## About the project:

> ExpressJS form generation, embedding, monitoring, and notifications for Javascript Natives

This repository in particular is for **FormlyUI**, the VueJS front end that pairs with our ExpressJS backend. You can find the backend counterpart [here](). We will be releasing a docker box of the entire app in the near future, so watch this repository for updates.

To see the current backlog/status of the project, we have a public feature board [here](https://trello.com/b/s4Rkd2lQ).
